### Example

Explore an example showcasing a straightfoward alert with both an icon and a message:

```markdown
[blocks-alert]
icon: "fa-info-circle"
content: "A simple alert"
[/blocks-alert]
```

### Output

The example above renders as:

[blocks-alert]
icon: "fa-info-circle"
content: "A simple alert"
[/blocks-alert]

The "fa-info-circle" icon from FontAwesome is utilized in this case to denote an informational message.

Feel free to experiment with various icons and messages to tailor your alerts to your content's context.

Remember to consistently use double quotes and maintain proper indentation for polished syntax.
