# Blocks Markdown

Discuss the syntax of blocks markdown. Demo how a single component works ...

```blocks-card
title: "Hi!"
caption: "Keep your content looking fresh."
image: "../assets/blocks-watermark.png"
button: "Alerts"
link: "components/alerts.md"
```

or, how grouping multiple components can work through the blocks top-level constructs such as rows, or containers ...

<blocks-row

    ```blocks-card
    title: "Hi!"
    caption: "Keep your content looking fresh."
    image: "../assets/blocks-watermark.png"
    button: "Alerts"
    link: "components/alerts.md"
    ```
    ```blocks-card
    title: "Welcome"
    caption: "With modern Bootstrap components."
    image: "../assets/blocks-watermark.png"
    button: "Badges"
    link: "components/badges.md"
    ```
    ```blocks-card
    title: "To ..."
    caption: "That you can write in markdown."
    image: "../assets/blocks-watermark.png"
    button: "Buttons"
    link: "components/buttons.md"
    ```
    ```blocks-card
    title: "Blocks!"
    caption: "Using the power of Blocks."
    image: "../assets/blocks-watermark.png"
    button: "Cards"
    link: "components/cards.md"
    ```
